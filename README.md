## Try out the Yaya Player at home

> Look over grandmas shoulder, as she watches her big screen TV, delighting in a channel of media created just for her and shared direct to her TV. With just a $35 chromecast configured on wifi/TV, use your chrome browser to visit a test, 'viewing' page where 3 simple button taps bring on a show created by a 5 year old for her grandma. Watch a series of videos from a live YayaTV channel delivered from the cloud to your TV.

### Simple and fun for grandma right at her TV:

* No remote required, the webpage turns the tv set on. The web page sets the TV's 'input source'
* Just tap a few buttons on the web page and the Tv will start steaming videos from the yaya channel
* The better the TV, the better the viewing experience
* Almost as good as having the grandkids there in the room!

**Note about Channels, Users and media shares**

Photo above has a yaya channel with 2 participants or members (one of the 2 users produces videos, the other watches).
**investor-portal** may view media messages from  **retireeB** ( or anyone else in a larger group than this one). If you are comfortable with **google+ groups**, this should be a familiar concept. This illustration provides an insight on the robust CDN underlying Yaya's secure infrastructure.
