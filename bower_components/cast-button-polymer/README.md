#cast-button-polymer
This element renders the cast button and manages it's states.  This button uses polymer for data 
binding and rendering, to find out more about Polymer take a look at the 
[Polymer documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org).

#Overview
This button starts by detecting if a cast device is available, it's hidden by default and becomes 
visible if a device is found.  It also displays a tool tip to notify of the button onclick action.

Clicking the button to start the cast selection process also starts the connection animation.

Once a cast connection is established the button is overlayed in blue.

When connected, you can use the CastManager methods to control the casting content.

For a sample of the cast button, take a look at the 
[CastVideos-material](https://github.com/googlecast/CastVideos-material) sample.

#Setup
Use [Bower](http://bower.io/) to include the cast-button in your web app.  The following command 
will add the cast-button and it's dependencies to your project.

    bower install --save googlecast/cast-button-polymer

#Integration
The easiest way to integrate is to use one of the already provided elements which contain 
cast-button.  The instructions below cover a custom integration.  You'll need to first include 
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/getting-the-code.html).

##Including the element
In your html include the element

    <link rel="import"
        href="bower_components/cast-button-polymer/cast-button-polymer.html">


Add the element to your HTML replacing appId with your receiver appId.

    <cast-button id="button_cast" appId="{{ appId }}" color="white"></cast-button>

##Initializing the element
Create a media object following the format below

    var media = {
      "title": "Big Buck Bunny",
      "description": "Fusce id nisi turpis. Praesent viverra bibendum semper. Donec tristique, orci sed semper lacinia, quam erat rhoncus massa, non congue tellus est quis tellus. Sed mollis orci venenatis quam scelerisque accumsan. Curabitur a massa sit amet mi accumsan mollis sed et magna. Vivamus sed aliquam risus. Nulla eget dolor in elit facilisis mattis. Ut aliquet luctus lacus. Phasellus nec commodo erat. Praesent tempus id lectus ac scelerisque. Maecenas pretium cursus lectus id volutpat.",
      "url": "https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4",
      "studio": "Blender Foundation",
      "thumbnailImageUrl": "//commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/images_480x270/BigBuckBunny.jpg",
      "largeImageUrl": "//commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/images_780x1200/BigBuckBunny-780x1200.jpg"
    };
    
In the `polymer-ready` event instantiate the CastManager object and set the field on the cast-button.

    window.addEventListener('polymer-ready', function() {
      var castButton = document.getElementById("cast_button");
        
      var castManager = new cast.CastManager(media);
      castButton.castManager = castManager;
    }


#Controlling content
The CastManager object has methods to control the casting media.  In the code below, we're adding 
a click handler to the play button which plays the cast media.

    playButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
      if (castManager.hasCastSession()){
        castManager.play(cast.CastManager.SENDER.LOCAL);
      }
    });

The other methods can be found in the CastManager prototype.
