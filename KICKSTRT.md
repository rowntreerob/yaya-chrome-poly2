## Try out the Yaya Player at home

> Look over grandmas shoulder as she enjoys a channel of media curated by younger family members and shared direct to her TV. With just a chromecast configured on wifi and a TV set, use a chrome browser on a test page where 3 button taps will get videos from a live Yaya channel created by a 5 year old, playing video greetings she shared to grandma. 

### Simple and fun for grandma right at her TV:

* No remote required, the webpage smoothly does the stuff grandma never learned about the remote
* Just tap a few buttons on the page and the Tv will start steaming videos from the channel
* The better the TV, the better the viewing experience
* Almost as good as having the grandkids there in the room!

4. In the chrome browser, install the [chromecast extension](http://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/devices/chromecast/learn.html#how-to-cast-chrome-tab). This

Note about Channels, Users and permissions.  User **investor-portal** has been granted access to view a channel (_sf_temp_smpl_chann) where content has been created by another user (retireeB) and shared to 'grandma' who in this case is user=investor-portal. If you are comfortable with google+ groups, this should be a familiar concept. This illustration provides an insight on the robust CDN underlying Yaya's secure infrastructure.
